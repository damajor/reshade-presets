## Hints
* ReShade main website: https://reshade.me
* Install & use: The quick and dirty way => Read everything in the download section of the main website (this is very short).
* More information on how it works: https://reshade.me/forum/general-discussion/2501-reshade-3-0-guide-for-newcomers (I do not recommend the workaround in the last part of the first post).
* Just paste or copy the preset file in the same directory of the game executable.
* Having only the desired shader (.fx) files in your ReShade directory makes ReShade load faster.

## Todo
* more presets
